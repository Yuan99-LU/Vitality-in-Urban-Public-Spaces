# Vitality-in-Urban-Public-Spaces
Jane Jacobs’s view of diversity conditions to urban vitality is widely accepted and tested by different researchers, but mostly used single-source or simplified multi-source data sets as proxies of urban vitality. The diversity conditions she promoted are limited to static buildings, streets, distances to various city service stations and parks, while ignoring contribution of diversity conditions from people themselves and their subjective perception to urban vitality, due to lack of data to detect what exactly people behaviours and how they are interacting with environment. Newly obtained geo-tagged data together with advanced deep learning AI and topic modelling help address this issue. Combining with analysis of review texts from restaurants and attractions, it discloses the fact that people’s subjective perception on public urban spaces varies with time periods and culture background. As urban vitality is defined as the interaction between human and built-in environment, people’s subjective perception is undoubtedly one of the direct indicators to urban vitality.
