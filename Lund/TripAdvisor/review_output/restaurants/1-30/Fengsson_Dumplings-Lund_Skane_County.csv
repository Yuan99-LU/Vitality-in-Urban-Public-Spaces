[English],38,25,2.0,5,"December 2, 2017 ",Good place for lunch & dinner,"Lund, Sweden","这家煎饺店就在法学院后门出来二十米，好像是四川人开的。门面不太起眼，要往地下走。店里面也很小，只有几张桌子。但人气一直挺旺的。

饺子的话，我吃过的有猪肉、鸡肉、素菜，可以随意组合，10个69克朗，15个89克朗。除此之外还可以在米饭、面条、米粉中选一个主食，再选一个蘸饺子的酱料，价钱包括在内。提供免费的汤，味道很像冬阴功。

饺子的味道还是可以的，个人喜欢稍微焦一点的，口感比较脆。素菜的那个做得有点面，以致我再也没尝试过第二次。最推荐面条米粉配的那个酱料，和上面撒的花生脆，真的好吃。

除了堂食，食物也可以打包带走，每一个都有单独的盒子，餐具自取，很方便。

感觉老板娘对自家食物和服务的质量要求都挺高的，每次去都听到她不是在数落这个店员就是在数落那个。希望他们的饺子能一直保持好的品质...
