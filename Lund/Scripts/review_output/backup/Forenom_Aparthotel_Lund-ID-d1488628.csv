Jiehu,Nov 2018,5,非常舒适的公寓式酒店,十分满意！这里的优点有很多: 1，房间带厨房，厨房里的锅刀叉碗碟一应俱全，油盐需要自己买，但很便宜。2，早餐非常丰盛好吃，尤其推荐那个牛角面包，皮非常酥脆，鸡蛋也被细心的分成6分钟和8分钟鸡蛋，周末早餐到10点半，工作日到9点半。3，旁边就有一个大超市和药店，非常方便，出来买东西都不用穿大衣。4，离伦德火车站和伦德大学都是20分钟走路到，不算太近，但也能接受，唯一就是这里都是石板路，第一次来提着箱子一路走来非常痛苦。如果再来这里的话，肯定还会选择这里的，非常推荐！对了，这里的服务也蛮好的，妹子们礼貌友好。,"Response from ForenomAparthotelLun, Chef at Forenom Aparthotel LundResponded Dec 11, 2018","Responded Dec 11, 2018","Best Jiehu,  Many thanks for giving such a positive and extensive review of your stay.
