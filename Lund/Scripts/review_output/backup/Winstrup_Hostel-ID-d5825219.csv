This is exactly how we get input to constantly improve and become a hostel where all guests feel they have really had a great experience and that they have gotten good value for the money spent. Please let me respond to the things you did not like so much:  Noise from lower beds: You are absolutely right - noise from the lower beds have been one of our teething problems. The good news is that we have identified both the problem and the solution. So far we have re-built 15 out of 19 lower beds to be silent. By July 15 all beds should be done.  Dangerous top beds: We understand that some people may at first feel a bit scared about falling out from the top beds. We have during the first four months since we opened this spring been interviewing many people about this. Nobody has ever fallen out and the reason is that the ""outer edge"" is so wide (20 cm) and we have tried to roll over it while lying down, but it's impossible. The conclusion is that the beds are safe and they also look much better and are much easier to get in to if we don't put up some kind of fence, which of course is an alternative. For guests that still feel uncertain we always manage to provide a lower bed.  Finally we have talked to the girl who worked during your stay and also shown her this review. This remark is something we take really seriously - such behaviour is far from acceptable no matter how bad day you may have for whatever reason. After our discussions we feel very sure that this will not happen again in the future and I think that you can see from all other reviews here that we have great staff that are really service minded and professional.  Thanks again for your review and most welcome back to us next time you are in Lund!  Milla",Date of stay: July 2014,"[All, languages]",145

The problem was the behaviour of the guest and how it was disturbing other guests. This has nothing at all to do with the colour of the skin. We had received several complaints from other guests and there were several other guests around when we politely but firmly asked the guest to leave our place and we received many positive comments from them afterwards.   We have received around 1100 public reviews on the internet for our three accommodations in Lund (Winstrup Hostel, CheckInn B&B and Hotell Oskar) where we are scoring top position on all sites in all categories. In one review (this one) we are accused for something terrible like this.  Our guests come from all over the world - we love diversity and different cultures.

But as you know we got a bit concerned with your comment about the room being less organised as this was the first time we got a not so positive comment about cleanliness.  After being in contact with you we understood that it was not the cleaning by our staff that was the problem, but more the ""organisation skills"" of your room-mates. Of course the level of how well you keep your stuff varies between people and we cannot comment on how it looked during your particular stay.  Our staff has crystal clear instructions on what's included in the daily, weekly and monthly cleaning of all areas of Winstrup Hostel and everything is documented in logbooks. At the same time they have clear instructions not to organise the luggage of our guests (only move things a bit in order to make sure they can clean under). They will not fold clothes, pick up stuff from the floor, make beds etc.  The action we took immediately was to add information about ""house rules"" on the website and in the welcome information letter that everyone gets when checking in. Here it is clear that the guests should keep their stuff in good order - let's hope hat this was a one-time issue and that the more clear information also helps...  One more thing we will do is to go through each dorm one more time to make sure we have enough hooks and shelves in every room.  :-)  Welcome back next time you're in Lund  Klas",Date of stay: June 2014,"[All, languages]",145

We agree totally that the upper bunks are a bit challenging to climb and this is also why we always prepare the beds for our guests, which we believe is quite unusual in hostels. Our staff have become specialists in entering upper bunks in a fast and safe manner... :-)  We are also happy to inform you that we have now finally received the last pieces of equipment needed to get our new giga-speed network connected so we should be up and running very soon throughout the whole hostel.
