Det är mycket viktigt för oss att höra vad våra gäster tycker om sin vistelse och ger oss möjlighet att utveckla oss och bli ännu bättre på det vi gör. Det verkar som att du trivdes bra på hotellrummet, vilket gläder mig, förutom med mattan på golvet. Vi har hotellrum både med matta och med parkett. Vad synd att du inte blev tillfrågad vid incheckningen vilket du föredrar - vi måste alltså bli bättre på att ställa den frågan! Mattan är för övrigt tillverkad av 80% ull och 20% nylon. Ull som är helt och hållet ett förnybart, naturligt material är en av våra mest hållbara materialresurser i världen. Ull har också en slags självrenande funktion som gör att den är lätt att hålla ren. Vi ångtvättar våra mattor med jämna mellanrum. Med vatten och ett milt rengöringsmedel. Inget annat. Vad gäller telefonen så är det en satsning där vi har vågat sticka ut hakan lite. Helt enkelt en vision om att minska antalet elektroniska produkter som tillverkas i världen. I stort sett varenda en av våra hotellgäster har egen telefon med sig och det brukar fungera väldigt bra. Telefonnumret till receptionen står på första uppslaget i den informationsfolder som står i stället ovanför skrivbordet. På alla rum. Jag hoppas verkligen att du lyckades komma i kontakt med receptionen för att framföra ditt ärende.   Jag förstod också av ditt omdöme att du tyckte vår frukost var en trevlig upplevelse om än dåligt skyltad. Detta tar vi åt oss av och plockar genast fram de fina små skyltar som vi faktiskt har. Hoppas verkligen att du trots fel typ av rum och avsaknad av skyltar på frukostbuffén fick en fin arbetsdag efter du hade besökt oss. Om du kommer att besöka oss igen, tveka inte att kontakta undertecknad, jag berättar gärna mer om vårt miljöarbete och vårt fina hotell.
